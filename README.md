muddle
======

A clojure library for playing word games like scrabble.

Based on the algorithms described by Appel and Jacobson, but with some simplifications and the implementation modified to fit with clojures immutable data strutures and functional style.

See their paper for more details on the algorithm (eg http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf).
